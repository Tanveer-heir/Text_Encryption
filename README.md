# Advanced Encryption Utility

A Python GUI application for encrypting and decrypting text using multiple cipher techniques including Caesar Cipher, Reverse Cipher, and ROT13 Cipher. This tool also supports letter frequency analysis, theme toggling, and file operations for saving and copying outputs.

## Features

- **Cipher Types:** Caesar Cipher with custom shift, Reverse Cipher, ROT13 Cipher
- **Encryption & Decryption:** Seamless toggle between encrypting and decrypting text
- **Text Analysis:** Letter frequency count for cryptanalysis support
- **User Interface:** Easy-to-use Tkinter GUI with theme toggle (light/dark)
- **File Operations:** Save output to files and copy results to clipboard
- **Random Shift Generator:** Automatic random shift for Caesar Cipher

## Usage

1. Enter text in the input box.
2. Select a cipher type from the dropdown.
3. For Caesar Cipher, set the shift value or use the "Random Shift" button.
4. Click **Encrypt** to encrypt the text.
5. Click **Decrypt** to decrypt the text.
6. Use **Analyze Text** to view letter frequency.
7. Copy output to clipboard or save it as a file using the buttons.
8. Toggle between light and dark mode for UI preference.
